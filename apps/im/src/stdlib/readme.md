<h2>im_std_worker.erl</h2>

This module provides a simple worker behavior with a supervisor for handling various tasks within the application. It exports functions that are used to manage the worker processes and their supervisors:

- <b>start_link/1</b>: Starts a new worker process and links it to the caller.
- <b>init/1</b>: Initializes the worker process with the given arguments.
- <b>sys_name/2</b>: Returns the system name for a worker based on the provided module and ID.
- <b>spec/3</b>: Returns the supervisor spec for a worker with the given module, ID, and arguments.
- <b>call/2</b>: Sends a synchronous request to the worker and waits for the response.
- <b>cast/2</b>: Sends an asynchronous request to the worker without waiting for the response.




<h2>im_std_worker_server.erl</h2>

This module implements the gen_server behavior and provides functions for processing requests from clients and maintaining the state of the worker:

- <b>start_link/2</b>: Starts a new worker process, links it to the caller, and initializes it with the given arguments.
- <b>init/1</b>: Initializes the worker process state with the given arguments.
- <b>handle_call/3</b>: Processes a synchronous request from a client and returns a response.
- <b>handle_cast/2</b>: Processes an asynchronous request from a client and updates the worker state if necessary.
- <b>handle_info/2</b>: Processes any other messages sent to the worker and updates the worker state if necessary.
- <b>terminate/2</b>: Cleans up the worker state when the worker is terminated.
- <b>code_change/3</b>: Handles changes in the worker's code, allowing the worker to continue running with the updated code.
