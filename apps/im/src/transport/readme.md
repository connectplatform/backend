<h1>Transport</h1>

im_transport_http.erl: This module provides a handler for HTTP requests. It exports a function called handle/2, which is responsible for processing incoming messages via HTTP. It supports processing messages with or without authentication tokens and also handles CORS requests.

im_transport_ws.erl: This module provides a handler for WebSocket connections. It implements the sm_websocket behavior and exports a function called handle/2. This function is responsible for processing incoming messages via WebSocket connections, handling user authentication, and managing user state.


<h2>im_transport_http.erl</h2>

This module provides a handler for processing incoming HTTP requests. It exports the following function:

- <b>handle/2</b>: Responsible for processing messages received via HTTP. It supports processing messages with or without authentication tokens and handles CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) requests.




<h2>im_transport_ws.erl</h2>

This module provides a handler for managing WebSocket connections. It implements the sm_websocket behavior and exports the following function:

- <b>handle/2</b>: Responsible for processing messages received via WebSocket connections. It handles user authentication and manages user state.




<h2>im_transport_router.erl</h2>

This module is responsible for processing and routing different types of messages in a Connect Platform instant messaging system.

The module exports the following functions:

- <b>process/4</b>: Processes incoming messages by checking their authentication and routing them to the appropriate handler function.
- <b>msg_needs_auth/1</b>: Determines if a given message type requires authentication.
- <b>get_version_number/0</b>: Retrieves the current protocol version.
- <b>parse_version_number/1</b>: Parses the protocol version number from a message.
- <b>handle/4</b>: Handles a message, routing it to the appropriate function based on its type and version.
- <b>format_record/1</b>: Formats a record to be returned as a response.
- <b>acl_filter/2</b>: Determines if a user has the necessary role or permission to perform a certain action. It takes a message and a user ID as input and returns a boolean result.
- <b>get_version_number/0</b>: Retrieves the protocol version number from an ETS table, if available. It returns the version number as an integer or undefined if not found.
- <b>parse_version_number/1</b>: Parses the version number from the request's path, header, or query string. Returns the version number as a string or undefined.
- <b>parse_record/2</b>: Converts the message to a versioned record format based on the given version number. It takes a version number and a message as input.
- <b>format_record/1</b>: Formats a message by removing any version numbers present in its record name. It takes a message as input.
- <b>remove_record_version/1</b>: Removes the version number from a message's record name.
- <b>modify_record_name_nested/2</b>: Applies the given predicate to all nested records within a message.
- <b>log/4</b>: Logs a message based on the request and response, along with the user information. It takes a version, request message, response, and user as input.

The module contains a large case statement in the <b><i>handle_message/4</i></b> function that checks the message type and routes it to the appropriate function. The various message types include:

- <b>'RtcMessage'</b>: Real-time communication messages.
- <b>'SocialAuth'</b>: Social authentication messages.
- <b>'Pages'</b>: Page-related messages.
- <b>'ClearState'</b>: State clearing messages.
- <b>'RequestVerification'</b>: Verification request messages.
- <b>'ConfirmVerification'</b>: Verification confirmation messages.
- <b>'AddFeedback'</b>: Feedback addition messages.
- <b>'ChangeCronTime'</b>: Cron time change messages.
- <b>'UserRoles'</b>: User role messages.

And many other message types related to instant messaging features, such as chat rooms, messages, calls, channels, feeds, likes, locations, contacts, and more.

The <b><i>process/4</i></b> function handles the processing of messages, including updating the protocol version, checking for authentication, and routing the message to the appropriate handler function.

The main use of this module is to process incoming requests, ensure proper access control for the user, and generate appropriate responses. The module uses ACL (Access Control Lists) to manage the permissions and roles of users within the system. It also supports versioning of messages, which allows the system to handle different versions of messages and ensure backward compatibility.

In summary, this module is responsible for managing incoming requests, ensuring proper access control, and generating responses. It ensures that users have the necessary permissions and roles to perform actions, and it logs messages for debugging and monitoring purposes.




<h1>Routes</h1>

In summary, these three Erlang modules handle different aspects of the application:

- <b>im_feed_post_route.erl</b>: Handles feed post-related requests and renders the feed post HTML template.
- <b>im_media_route.erl</b>: Handles media-related requests and returns the associated media file content.
- <b>im_profile_route.erl</b>: Handles profile-related requests and renders the user profile HTML template.

These Erlang files define three different route handlers for a Connect-powered application:




<h2>im_feed_post_route.erl</h2>

This module handles requests related to feed posts. It exports a single function, <b>handle/1</b>, which takes a Req (request) as input. The function retrieves the feed post from the given ID in the request, finds the associated thumbnail, and renders an HTML template (feed-post.html) using the erlydtl library. The resulting HTML is returned as the response.




<h2>im_media_route.erl</h2>

This module handles media-related requests. It exports a single function, <b>handle/1</b>, which takes a Req (request) as input. The function retrieves the media file associated with the given hash in the request. If the file is found, it reads the content of the file and returns it in the response with the appropriate content type. If the file is not found or an error occurs, an appropriate error response is returned.





<h2>im_profile_route.erl</h2> 

This module handles profile-related requests. It exports a single function, <b>handle/1</b>, which takes a Req (request) as input. The function retrieves the user profile associated with the given user ID in the request. If the user is found, it renders an HTML template (profile.html) using the erlydtl library and returns the resulting HTML in the response. If the user is not found, a 404 status is returned.
