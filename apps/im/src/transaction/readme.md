<h2>im_transaction.erl</h2>

This module provides a transactional interface for executing functions in a sequential and atomic manner, ensuring data consistency and integrity. It exports the following functions:

- <b>execute/3</b>: Executes a single function atomically. Takes a function, a lock key, and a timeout as arguments. It first acquires the lock for the given key and then calls the provided function. If the function call is successful, the lock is released. Otherwise, the lock remains in place, preventing other transactions from modifying the locked resource.
- <b>execute_all/3</b>: Executes a list of functions atomically. Takes a list of functions, a lock key, and a timeout as arguments. It acquires the lock for the given key and then calls each function in the list sequentially. If all the function calls are successful, the lock is released. Otherwise, the lock remains in place, preventing other transactions from modifying the locked resource.




<h2>im_transaction_sup.erl</h2>

This module is a supervisor for im_transaction and is responsible for managing the worker processes associated with transactions. It implements a simple_one_for_one supervisor strategy, which means that a new im_transaction worker is started for each call. This strategy allows for dynamic worker creation, enabling the system to scale with the number of concurrent transactions. The module exports the following functions:

- <b>start_link/0</b>: Starts a new supervisor process and links it to the caller.
- <b>init/1</b>: Initializes the supervisor with the required child specification for im_transaction workers.
